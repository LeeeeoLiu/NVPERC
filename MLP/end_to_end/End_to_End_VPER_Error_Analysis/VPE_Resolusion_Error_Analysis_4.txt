Factory officials estimate that more than 10 % of the work force here is redundant , but layoffs are n't allowed . Even factory workers ' children are guaranteed jobs . The industrial monoliths are so deeply involved in the welfare system that China 's leaders may never be able to modernize them , despite their glaring economic inefficiency . Though the Panzhihua factory itself is profitable , many such enterprises are n't . Subsidies for money-losing enterprises totaled $ 18 billion last year , or about one-third the total state revenue .

Richard Nixon exacerbated the problem when , in response to pressures from Congress , he applied price and wage controls in August 1971 , thereby discouraging production . Jimmy Carter ultimately hired Mr. Volcker to kill inflation , which was reaching dangerous levels . He did , too late to save Mr. Carter from forced retirement .

For instance : `` Haole '' ( white ) is not the ultimate insult ; `` Mainland haole '' is . Richard Chamberlain dresses as a `` Mainland haole , '' tucking in a Hawaiian shirt and rolling up its long sleeves . And the local expression for brother is `` brah , '' not `` bruddah .

Sorry , the show does not even have the one redeeming quality of genuine local color .

There are many reasons to think that what appeared Friday is another species of bear , and a less vicious one . The reasons include the obvious differences in the market between this fall and 1987 : Interest rates have n't been rising this time , as they were in 1987 ; the dollar , though hit Friday , has n't been eroding dangerously ; the economy is n't overheating ; and , above all , stocks are far from being as wildly overpriced : They are selling at only about 13 times per-share earnings , compared with about 20 two years ago .

Until recently , national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising . Since production costs were guaranteed , it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into syndication , as most American programs are . But not much money was spent on the shows , either , a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows , while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas .

'' One major topic during Mr. Roh 's visit will be human rights . Due process still is denied in South Korea ; a few months ago , Kim Dae Jung , the major opposition leader , was detained and interrogated for 20 hours by security thugs . Just as Pope John Paul II did in Seoul last week , President Bush and members of Congress ought to tell Mr. Roh in no uncertain terms that this kind of behavior is unacceptable .

This was a hangover from Friday , when Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks . The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized . They did n't .

But as soon as the accords were signed , American officials sharply reduced aid . In February 1989 , when the Soviets said they had completed their pullout , the U.S. cut it further .

To do so , Bull is planting itself firmly in the U.S. , where , says Mr. Lorentz , a lot of the best people and research are . The Zenith buy means Bull will derive 22 % of its revenue from the U.S. -- up from 18 % previously -- and the company spends 30 % of its 3.64 billion-franc research and development budget in the U.S .

There is the constant insistence that the Fed could lower interest rates were it not so obstinate . The Fed indeed can lower short-term interest rates by pumping reserves into the banks , but it ca n't do much about them from there on . If the reserves generate inflation , which is what the Fed fears most right now , interest rates will go up as lenders demand a premium . Enough inflation can ultimately even wipe out the bond market , as it did in Britain in the 1970s , thereby crippling the economy .

There are many reasons to think that what appeared Friday is another species of bear , and a less vicious one . The reasons include the obvious differences in the market between this fall and 1987 : Interest rates have n't been rising this time , as they were in 1987 ; the dollar , though hit Friday , has n't been eroding dangerously ; the economy is n't overheating ; and , above all , stocks are far from being as wildly overpriced : They are selling at only about 13 times per-share earnings , compared with about 20 two years ago .

The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral American caveat , that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did . But as soon as the accords were signed , American officials sharply reduced aid . In February 1989 , when the Soviets said they had completed their pullout , the U.S. cut it further .
