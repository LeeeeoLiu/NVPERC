# NVPERC

This is the implement of **A Neural Approach for Verb Phrase Ellipsis Resolution (AAAI-19)**.

# Code

The codes are consist of two parts:

- ```/MLP``` includes the codes and experiments for MLP Classifier, which is contributed by **[LeeeeoLiu](https://github.com/LeeeeoLiu)**.
- ```/T2T``` for Tensor2Tensor Classifier, which is contributed by **[Daviddddl](https://github.com/Daviddddl)**.

> Caution: the MLP is based on PyTorch and Python2, however, the T2T is based on Tensorflow and Python3.

# Data

The data is too large to upload to Github. You can download from the following two ways :

- Google Drive.

- Baidu Cloud Disk: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1AQefeMv9UfPVO_AU7NGx0Q 
  - Extraction Code: jpgv 

You can also use the ```MLP/prepare_data.py``` to generate the training data.
